<h1>Motivation & Introduction</h1>
<p>This project was my third project for the Software Engineering Immersive course, which was done in a team of 4. The aim was to build a fullstack MERN application using your own RESTful API. As a team we started out brainstorming on several ideas and interests, we all wanted an ecommerce app but yet wanted it to be based on a unique product, we soon realised we all had a common interest in hot drinks either tea or coffee so we decided to build an application that allows users to shop and suggest hot drink. We decided on the name 'Heiss' (hei√ü) which is 'hot' in German for the app.
  
The market fit of our application is that most professionals start out their day with a hot drink, either tea or coffee. One of the health benefit of taking hot drinks is that it may temporarily improve circulation by causing the arteries and veins to expand. The cultural fit also is something we considered. 
</p>

<h1>Preparation & Organisation</h1>
<h3>Application Structural Sketch</h3>
<p>After deliberating on the functionalities and design direction we wanted to go as a group, I started out with a sketch of the app's models and functionality in order for me to understand how our app would work at a fundamental level.</p>

<h3>Wireframe</h3>Then I went ahead to create a UI wireframe for the project based on the team's design direction. The main components are the home page, index page, profile page, basket(cart) page. Basket is accessed through the show page displaying each product.</p>

<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>We decided to manage the project sprints and development using Trello. As tasks were delegated to individuals on the team and also indicate tasks we chose to execute as a group.</p>

<p>I will give an overview of the app's architecture and delve into more detail on some of the features I built.</p>
